## 3.0.1

- Updated links in README.md to use `https` protocol.

## 3.0.0

- **BREAKING CHANGES**:
  - Locale is no longer part of the `locationFromAddress` and `placemarkFromAddress`, but should be set first by `setLocaleIdentifier`. This was already implemented on Android but is now working similarly on iOS.
  - Updates documentation related to setting the locale.
  - Added `setLocaleIdentifier` to the example app.
  - Updates `geocoding_ios` version to 3.0.0.

## 2.2.2

- Updates documentation for isPresent().
- Removes unused `LocaleIdentifier` parameter for isPresent().

## 2.2.1+1

- Reverts changes from version `2.2.1`, `2.2.1` should not be used. Use either version `2.2.1+1` or `3.0.0`.

## 2.2.1

- Updates documentation related to setting the locale.
- Added `setLocaleIdentifier` to the example app.
- Updates `geocoding_ios` version to 3.0.0.

## 2.2.0

- Exposes the `isPresent()` method which on Android returns `true` if the
  geocoding backend service are present on the device, otherwise returns `false`.
  On iOS this method always returns `true`.

## 2.1.1

- Updates the example app, so the `example/lib/main.dart` contains clear example
  code on how to use the geocoding plugin. Mean reason for doing so is that the
  `example/lib/main.dart` is shown in the "Example" tab on pub.dev.

## 2.1.0

- Upgrades the app-facing package to use the federated architecture.

## 2.0.6

- Upgrades `compileSdkVersion` to `33` on Android.
- Fix issues in example project.

## 2.0.4

- Fixes link to the Android migration guide in README.

## 2.0.3

- Upgrades `compileSdkVersion` to `31` on Android.
- Resolves Android embedding deprecation warning.

## 2.0.2

- Migrate maven repository from jcenter to mavenCentral.

## 2.0.1

- Update the plugin version number in the README file to the newest version;
- Update the example app to use `compileSdkversion 30` and `targetSdkversion 30` in the `build.gradle`.

## 2.0.0

- Migrate to null safety.

## 1.0.5

- Make sure the README.md specifies the correct links to Apple's CLGeocoder and Android's Geocoder APIs (see [#20](https://github.com/baseflow/flutter-geocoding/pull/20));
- Update the documentation to mention correct usage for the `locationFromAddress` feature (see [#21](https://github.com/baseflow/flutter-geocoding/pull/21))

## 1.0.4+1

- Make sure the README.md mentions the correct version number.

## 1.0.4

- Added NoResultFoundException to indicate when no results are found, instead of PlatformException

## 1.0.3+1

- Make sure the supplied locale is respected (see issue [#10](https://github.com/Baseflow/flutter-geocoding/issues/10))

## 1.0.3

- Make sure public types defined in the geocoding_platform_interface are also available from the geocoding package (see [#6](https://github.com/Baseflow/flutter-geocoding/issues/6)).

## 1.0.2

- Solve `IllegalFormatConversionException` on Android when geocoding request could not be resolved (see [#5](https://github.com/Baseflow/flutter-geocoding/issues/5)).
