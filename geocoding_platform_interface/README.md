A common platform interface for the [`geocoding`][1] plugin.

This interface allows platform-specific implementations of the `geocoding`
plugin, as well as the plugin itself, to ensure they are supporting the
same interface. Have a look at the [Federated plugins](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/packages-and-plugins/developing-packages#federated-plugins)
section of the official [Developing packages & plugins](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/packages-and-plugins/developing-packages)
documentation for more information regarding the federated architecture concept.

## Usage

To implement a new platform-specific implementation of `geocoding`, extend
[`GeocodingPlatform`][2] with an implementation that performs the
platform-specific behavior, and when you register your plugin, set the default
`GeocodingPlatform` by calling
`GeocodingPlatform.instance = MyPlatformGeocoding()`.

## Note on breaking changes

Strongly prefer non-breaking changes (such as adding a method to the interface)
over breaking changes for this package.

See https://flutter.dev/go/platform-interface-breaking-changes for a discussion
on why a less-clean interface is preferable to a breaking change.
