The Flutter geocoding plugin is build following the federated plugin architecture. A detailed explanation of the federated plugin concept can be found in the [Flutter documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/packages-and-plugins/developing-packages#federated-plugins). This means the geocoding plugin is separated into the following packages:

1. [`geocoding`][1]: the app facing package. This is the package users depend on to use the plugin in their project. For details on how to use the [`geocoding`][1] plugin you can refer to its [README.md][2] file. At this moment the Android and iOS platform implementations are also part of this package;
2. [`geocoding_platform_interface`][3]: this packages declares the interface which all platform packages must implement to support the app-facing package. Instructions on how to implement a platform packages can be found in the [README.md][4] of the [`geocoding_platform_interface`][3] package.
